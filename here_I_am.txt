It's a skin design for those who love simplicity. With (a lot of) transparancy in it, it's really good for your eyes. For more experience in using it, use Hidden mode.

If you find any bugs in my skin (some button are changed to default, missed the right spot, etc) you contact me by

Dont expect me to do a weekly update, since even a monthly update still pain in the ass for me. After the skin reach its final form, probably I won't working on it anymore.

Sorry for my horrible grammar....
